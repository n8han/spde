Spde
====

**Spde** is an offshoot of the [Processing][Processing] environment to
support sketches written in [Scala][scala], a powerfully
object-oriented and functional language.

In contrast to the [PDE][PDE], Spde is a *deconstructed toolkit*. For
starters that means you bring your own editor and Spde will compile
and run a sketch whenever you save it --- that's one option. The
entire process is controlled by Scala code you can use or
override. This structure should make Spde easy to extend and
customize. But who knows, for now it is just a scrappy little thing
with big ideas.

Because Scala runs on the Java Virtual Machine and can interface
directly with Java code, Spde is able to work with unmodified
Processing libraries. Its sketches will look similar to those in the
p5 dialect of Java if written in an imperative style, while an embrace
of immutability and other functional concepts will lead to entirely
different sketches. Please experiment.

Like Processing, Spde is free software under the LGPL. The full
sources to its Processing [extension library][lib] and
[sketch-builder][plugin] are on github.

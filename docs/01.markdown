Spde works in conjunction with [Simple Build Tool][sbt], a platform
for building, running, and packaging Scala applications. You can skip
installing sbt, for now, by downloading a Spde 'graft':

* [**Spde Graft $v$**](http://technically.us/spde-graft/graft_2.8.0-$v$-setup.jar)

This runnable jar will produce a simple project containing everything you need to start coding. Most systems will run the jar on a  double-click, but if that doesn't seem to work a command line will give better feedback:

    java -jar graft_2.8.0-$v$-setup.jar

It can take a minute. When the project is ready, its sample sketch will appear and play (yay). Inside the project directory should be a `sbt` or `sbt.bat` script, depending on your platform. Run this to enter sbt's [interactive mode][inter], where the `run` and `applet` actions should provide useful results. To make changes, open `sketch.spde` in any text editor.

<span id="source-only">At some point</span> you should [setup sbt][ss] to run Spde and other Scala projects independently. Then, you can base new projects off the **source-only Graft**, available in [tar.bz2][graft.tar.bz2] or [zip][graft.zip]. To fetch, compile, and run in one shot:

[graft.tar.bz2]: http://technically.us/git?p=graft.git;a=snapshot;h=$v$;sf=tbz2
[graft.zip]: http://technically.us/git?p=graft.git;a=snapshot;h=$v$;sf=zip

    curl "http://technically.us/git?p=graft.git;a=snapshot;h=$v$;sf=tbz2" \
      | tar -xvj
    cd graft
    sbt update run

* **Spde Examples $ex_v$** : [tar.bz2][tar.bz2] or [zip][zip]

The examples are an open-ended, group project. If you want to contribute new sketches or improve existing ones, [clone spde-examples on github][spde-examples] and go to work!

Spde Classic
------------

Spde was originally developed to compile and run inside a fork of the
Processing Development Environment. The final (probably) release of
this forked environment is $version$, available in two distributions
by BitTorrent or HTTP.

* Windows and Linux : [Direct download][gen-http] or [torrent][gen-tor]  

* Macintosh : [Direct download][mac-http]  or [torrent][mac-tor]  

[gen-tor]: http://technically.us/torrents/spde-app-gen-$version$.tgz.torrent
[gen-http]: http://spde.mirror.technically.us/spde-app-gen-$version$.tgz

[mac-tor]: http://technically.us/torrents/spde-app-mac-$version$.tgz.torrent
